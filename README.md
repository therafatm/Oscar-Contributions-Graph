# Oscar-Contributions-Graph

Tool for a class project that talks to the github API and uses Highcharts.js to draw out a contributions chart
for the OSCAR-EMR clinical management system. 

### To Run: 
  - Visit: https://web.uvic.ca/~rafatm/git.html
    - If this doesn't run the first time, try refreshing. Weird but sometimes doesn't work the first time for some reason.
  - Or you could clone the repo, and just load the file in a browser.
